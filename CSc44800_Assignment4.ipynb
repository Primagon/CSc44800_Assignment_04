It was 100% certain that the sample datapoint is in class 2. Then another surpising thing about the exercise was that for every other model, the score was 0.9333. Another surprise was that sklearn had their own inbuilt datasets. It was my first time loading data from sklearn and learning how to call the features and labels compared to how I did it in assignment 3."
